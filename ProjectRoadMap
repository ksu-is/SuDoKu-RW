Project Road Map

7/14: Create ReadMe File.
      -Watching youtube Sudoku Solver Python Video
      (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZJ5mjQyxR8&t=10s)
      
7/16: Found GitHub search with multiple Sudoku solvers.
      Some were to simple, but others were very difficult. Hoping to find one that challenges without being too extensive.
      May need to combine projects together

7/18: RoadMap File created:
      Added work that has already been done. 
      Created timeline for remained of the project. Hoping to get all coding down by 7/23. So i can completed powerpoint presentations
      
7/19: Found starter Python Solver with step by step instructions. Combining with one other python solver:

7/20: Added more detail to ReadMe.MD File
      -Trouble shooting the pip install for pygame and requests in sudoke tester code
       -Found Resolution to pygame install (used:https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-python-pygame-module-correctly/#:~:text=Install%20Python%20Pygame%20Module%20Use%20The%20Binary%20Installer,the%20Pygame%20installer%20downloaded%20directory.%20More%20items...%20)
      -Still working on resolution for requests. May need to change to interpreter that will work for both.
7/22: Found Resolution to Request imports (Check notes in Practice SuDoKu code file)
      Finished the code for game file. Still need to complete the solver.py file. But I feel confident that I will completed it. Today I made quite a few changes from the tutorial that I have been follwoing
      1. Find a website to find the pygame color format for the board layout
            -used https://python-forum.io/thread-1525.html#:~:text=blue%20%3D%20%28%280%2C0%2C255%29%29%20green%20%3D%20%28%280%2C255%2C0%29%29,red%20%3D%20%28%28255%2C0%2C0%29%29%20black%20%3D%20%28%280%2C0%2C0%29%29
      2.Adjsuted code to account for collor changes
            -Went thoruhg all lines and added the color that I wanted. I chose marron     
            -All of the tutorial only used black but I want it to be fun. My favorite color is green specfically matcha green. But there was someone else doing green.
      3. Find website to adjust font for pygame.
            -used https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-font/
      4. Adjusted code to account for new font.
      5. Found a total of 3 errors in my game() function
                 - forgot 2nd set of paratheseeses for window variable
                 -      incorrect indents in while loop
                              had more than one, but the indents is still something I have a hard time following.
                 -place function error in formating. Had to google proper formatting t use place. 
                        figured it out though. needed commas and I mispelled a variable.
      6. Checked code for errors again, and began planning the solver portion.
            Created python file, and new file in github. 
            Found tutorials on solver code. May refer to orginal video followed so i can follow if I make errors.
